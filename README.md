# Diabetes-Prediction-using-AI-ML
This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and family history. It includes data preprocessing, standardization, model training, and allows for manual user input at runtime to make real-time predictions.
