# Diabetes-Prediction-using-AI-ML
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, age, and family history. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, with data preprocessing and standardization applied using scikit-learn. The script includes accuracy evaluation on training and test sets and allows for manual user input at runtime to make real-time diabetes predictions. Both the dataset (diabetes.csv) and the Python code are included.
